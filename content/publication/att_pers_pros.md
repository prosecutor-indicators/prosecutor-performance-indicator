# What the Report is About:

In a project centered on prosecutorial performance, it is important to hear from prosecutors at all levels.  This report shows how prosecutors in each partner office think about definitions of success, office priorities, community engagement, incarceration, and racial disparities. The themes described in the report are not facts. Instead, they represent what prosecutors believe.

Our partner district and state attorney’s offices aim to use the findings from this report to improve management and communication. Before determining the best way to move forward, the offices must know where they currently stand. This includes understanding how line prosecutors define success and the extent to which they embrace the commitments and vision of their elected leaders. The confidential interviews and surveys provide candid assessments of line prosecutors’ views and sentiments. As this report details, each office has prosecutors that have fully embraced reform ideas as well as prosecutors who have not yet warmed up to this new way of thinking. Public safety remains an important focus, but prosecutors differ in terms of how they pursue this goal. Taking the offices’ temperature provides their leadership teams with a better understanding of when and how to roll out their reform ideas.

At the same time, the information in this report can be useful for the communities that these offices serve. Our partners have committed to conducting their work in full transparency so that they remain accountable to the public. This report is a demonstration of that commitment. Moreover, it is beneficial for community members to understand how prosecutors think about their job and mission. The hope is that this report will lead to productive conversations about how to protect the public, improve the justice system, and strengthen the relationship between prosecutors’ offices and their communities. With fast-changing societal views about justice and fairness, a report that documents prosecutors’ views on priorities and success can educate all of us about the narrowing or widening gap between community members and criminal justice actors.
