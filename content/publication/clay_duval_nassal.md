# What the Report is About:

The fair and just treatment of racial and ethnic minorities at all stages of the criminal justice system is    of  significant importance to communities of  color,  practitioners,  and scholars alike.  Central to this  discourse  is  a  recognition  of  the  discretionary  power  that  prosecutors  wield  in  shaping  the  outcomes of criminal cases. This includes, among other things, the decision to file or drop a   case,amend the severity and number of charges, and dispose of criminal cases through plea bargaining.

This  report  focuses  on  the  outcomes  of  prosecutorial  decision  making  in  Hillsborough  County,  Florida.  Specifically,  it   assesses the extent to which racial and ethnic disparities exist across the following five decision points in    criminal case processing: (1) Case filing; (2) Charge changes from arrest to    filing; (3) Disposition type; (4) Charge changes from filing to    disposition; and (5) Sentencing.

We encourage the reader to interpret the results while recognizing that criminal case processing can trigger disparate outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities for a number of different reasons. Some of these reasons, such as defense attorney role and judicial discretion, are beyond the immediate control  of  prosecutors.  At  the  same  time,  our  partners  are  keenly  aware  that  prosecutors  can  and  should  play  a  vital  role  in  uncovering  and  addressing  racial  and  ethnic  disparities  in  the  criminal  justice system, and this report stems from that recognition.

The intent of this report is   to prompt discussion and raise questions, rather than provide definitive answers. We also want to stress that the findings presented throughout this report cannot be used to support or refute possible racial and ethnic biases. Our methodology simply does not permit that. Rather than serving as an end point, we view this report as a starting point from which to engage in meaningful  discussions  concerning  policies  and  procedures  that  can  ameliorate  racial  and  ethnic  disparities  in  case  outcomes.  Furthermore,  given  that  prosecutorial  decision  making  does  not  operate in    a   vacuum, certain findings direct attention to ways state attorneyâ€™s offices, the defense bar,  law  enforcement  agencies,  and  the  judiciary  can  galvanize  future  reform  efforts.  Even  more  importantly,  continued  efforts  to  engage  with  minority  communities  will  be  critical  for  increasing  public trust in and cooperation with the criminal justice system.
