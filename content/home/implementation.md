  description = "Case management systems are the primary source of data for the PPIs. Other data sources may include the clerk of the court, the sheriff’s office, and human resources staff within the prosecutor’s offices. Because an office’s current capacity is unlikely to permit data collection for all desired PPIs, each office should discuss what additional data to collect and how to do so with minimal resource expenditure."

name = "What PPIs Don’t Measure"
description = "PPIs are not designed to measure individual prosecutor performance. Instead, they measure unit-level and office-wide performance over time. They also do not measure public opinion. While important, most offices do not have the ability to regularly survey the public about their performance."
