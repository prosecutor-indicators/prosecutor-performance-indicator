  name = "Why PPIs"
  description = "Prosecutorial performance has been traditionally measured by conviction rates and sentence length. Yet, public demand for greater accountability and impartiality also requires a focus on community well-being and fairness. PPIs help meet these demands by offering an array of metrics that can be tracked over time to inform decision making and policy development."

  name = "What PPIs Measure"
  description = "PPIs measure inputs, outputs, activities, and impacts of prosecutorial offices. They include timeliness of decision making, case prioritization, diversity of prosecutors, violent recidivism, participation in community events, frequency of contact with victims, diversion success rates, racial disparities in plea offers, accuracy in charging, and conviction integrity reviews."

  name = "How the PPIs Were Developed"
  description = "PPIs were developed through discussions with district and state attorneys, consultation with experts on prosecution and performance measurement, interviews with over 75 line prosecutors, field testing in four offices, review of existing criminal justice indicator tools, and our own experience developing indicators."
