| How it's Measured                  | % of all non\-DV cases dismissed within last 30 days that were filed within 1/2/3/6/9\+ months prior                             |
| Frequency                          | 30 days                                                                                                                          |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator  | Delayed case dismissals result in wasted time and resources\. Dismissals should occur as early in the case process as possible\. |
