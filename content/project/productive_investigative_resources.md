| Name of Indicator                 | Productive use of investigative resources                                                                                                                                          |
| How it's Measured                 | % of cases involving prosecutor-driven investigation that resulted in conviction                                                                                                   |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Prosecutors possess relatively few investigative resources. Those resources should be used only in cases where investigation substantially increases the likelihood of conviction. |
