| How it's Measured                 | Ratio between # of line attorneys and clerical staff/paralegals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Frequency                         | 120 days                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Prosecutors are responsible for a large amount of administrative work, much of which can be completed by individuals without a law degree. Providing sufficient clerical and paralegal staff allows prosecutors to focus on other substantive duties, increasing efficiency and job performance. |
