| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | \(\_\_% of convicted offenders go on to commit a new violent crime\.\) Prosecutors should effectively identify and incapacitate offenders with the highest risk of future violence\. |
