| How it's Measured | # of felony filings divided by # of line prosecutors AND # of misdemeanor filings divided by # of line prosecutors                                                                                               |

| Rationale For Measuring Indicator                | Prosecutors are often responsible for handling large volumes of cases. High caseloads limit the time and attention prosecutors can give to each case, which may affect the quality and speed of case processing. |
