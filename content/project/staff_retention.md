| How it's Measured | % of legal and non-legal staff who discontinued working at the office                                                                                                                                                |
| Frequency                | 120 days                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | High turnover in prosecutor's offices may negatively affect productivity and result in wasted resources. Staff attrition also disrupts workplace cohesion and job satisfaction among those who remain in the office. |
