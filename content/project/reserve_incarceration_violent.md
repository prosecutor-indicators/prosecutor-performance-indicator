| How it's Measured                 | # of incarceration sentences per 100 non-violent felony convictions                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Research indicates that incarceration has little positive impact on recidivism and may even be criminogenic, so alternative sanctions should be used for many non-violent individuals. Incarceration should be reserved for dangerous defendants. |
