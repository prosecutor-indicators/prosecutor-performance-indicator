| Name of Indicator        | Caseload Distribution Across Division/Bureaus                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| How it's Measured | Comparison of caseload for each non-specialized felony division                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Frequency                | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator                | An equitable distribution of cases across similar divisions enables prosecutors to give each case the same initial consideration. It additionally contributes to staff morale by ensuring prosecutors are assigned similar workloads. |
