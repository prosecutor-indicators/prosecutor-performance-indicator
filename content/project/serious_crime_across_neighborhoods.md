| How it's Measured                 | Ratio between % of felony cases rejected/dismissed in high crime and low crime zip codes                                                                                                                         |

| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Research suggests that cases originating in low\-income communities are more likely to be rejected or dismissed\. Prosecutorial efforts to achieve justice should be distributed equally among all communities\. |
