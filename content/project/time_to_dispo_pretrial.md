| Topic                             | Timeliness of Case Processing                                                                                                                                             |
| Indicator Number                  | 3.3                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Name of Indicator                 | Time to disposition for pretrial detainees                                                                                                                                |
| How it's Measured                 | Median # of days to first disposition for pretrial detainees charged with non-violent felonies                                                                            |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Extended periods of pretrial detention may have negative consequences for defendants’ home and work life. Cases involving detained defendants should be resolved quickly. |
