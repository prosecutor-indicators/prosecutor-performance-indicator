| Name of Indicator                 | Felony Recidivism Of Diversioners                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Theme                             | Community Safety & Well\-Being                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Topic                             | Addressing Serious Crime                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Indicator Number                  | 4\.4                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| How it's Measured                 | % of felony cases filed in which defendant completed diversion program within last year AND % of felony cases filed in which defendant failed diversion program within last year                                       |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Diversion is intended to reduce recidivism\. Diversioners who have completed programming should therefore constitute a smaller portion of felony caseloads than diversioners who have failed to complete programming\. |
