| Name of Indicator                  | Minimizing delays in case processing by limiting continuances                                                                                             |
| How it's Measured                  | Median \# of continuances requested by prosecutor before disposition in felony cases AND median \# of continuances requested by defendant in felony cases |
| Frequency                          | 30 days                                                                                                                                                   |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator  | Continuances requested by either the prosecution or the defense extend the time to case disposition and should be used sparingly\.                        |
