| Topic                             | Timeliness of Case Processing                                                                                                                                                              |
| Indicator Number                  | 3.2                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Name of Indicator                 | Efficient filing decisions for pretrial detainees                                                                                                                                          |
| How it's Measured                 | Median # of days from arrest to initial filing decision for detained defendants AND median # of days from arrest to initial filing decision for ROR/bonded defendants                      |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Extended periods of pretrial detention may have negative consequences for defendants’ home and work life. Filing decisions for cases involving detained defendants should be made quickly. |
