| Name of Indicator                 | Accurate diversion decisions & placements                                                                                                                                                       |
| How it's Measured                 | Ratio of # of defendants who completed diversion program and # of defendants who failed diversion program (including technical violations)                                                      |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Prosecutors must select the right defendants for diversion. Failure to properly match defendants to diversion programs will result in wasted resources and may do little to reduce crime rates. |
