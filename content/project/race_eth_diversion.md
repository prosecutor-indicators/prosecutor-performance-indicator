| How it's Measured                 | Ratio between % of black/Hispanic and white defendants diverted to treatment program/specialized court                          |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                         |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Research suggests that there are racial/ethnic disparities in which defendants are diverted away from traditional prosecution\. |
