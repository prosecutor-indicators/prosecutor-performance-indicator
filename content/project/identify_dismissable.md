| Name of Indicator                 | Ability to identify dismissable cases at filing                                                                                                                                                                 |
| How it's Measured                 | Ratio between # of cases rejected at filing and # of cases dismissed after filing                                                                                                                               |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Effectively filtering out under-evidenced cases at initial screening helps prosecutors minimize the portion of their limited resources that are spent on cases that will not ultimately result in a conviction. |
