| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Violent crime poses a significant threat to public safety\. Through the use of community prosecution strategies, selective incapacitation, alternative sanctions, and the proper allocation of rehabilitative resources, the prosecutor's office plays a critical role in preventing violence against the community\. |
