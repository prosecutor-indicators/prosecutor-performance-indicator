| Name of Indicator                 | Prioritizing Cases with Largest Public Safety Returns                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| How it's Measured                 | Ratio between # of B/2nd degree misdemeanor and violent felony case filings                                                                                                                                                             |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Though minor crimes occur at much higher rates, the prosecution of serious violent crimes has a larger potential impact on public safety. Violent felony cases should therefore comprise as much of prosecutors’ caseloads as possible. |
