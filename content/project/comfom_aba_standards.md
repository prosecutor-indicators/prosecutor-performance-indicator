| Topic                             | Timeliness of Case Processing                                                                                                                                                           |

| Name of Indicator                 | Conforming to ABA disposition time standards                                                                                                                                            |
| How it's Measured                 | % of cases resolved within the ABA standard (felonies within 120 days and misdemeanors within 30 days)                                                                                  |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Prolonged case resolutions require more prosecutorial resources and may also be unnecessarily detrimental to defendants’ well-being. Dispositions should be reached in a timely manner. |
