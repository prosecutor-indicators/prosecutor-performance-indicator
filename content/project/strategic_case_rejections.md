| How it's Measured                 | % rejected/dismissed cases done so in the interest of justice (as opposed to inability to prove or meet deadlines)                                                                                            |
| Frequency                         | 30 days                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Rationale For Measuring Indicator | Strategic case rejections and dismissals are an important mechanism through which prosecutors can use their discretion to achieve justice and communicate their priorities to law enforcement and the public. |
